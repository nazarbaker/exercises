	<p>In the paragraph below, the image will float to the right. 
	A dotted black border is added to the image. 
	We have also added margins to the image to push the text away
	from the image: 0 px margin on the top and right side,
	15 px margin on the bottom, and 20 px margin on the left side
	of the image.
