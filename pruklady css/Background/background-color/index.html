	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	
	<p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice
	that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like
	criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this
	world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'
